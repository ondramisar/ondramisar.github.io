Hi I am your random programmer from Czech Republic.
This blog is a collection of my personal random thoughts. Mainly focused on programming.
I have been working as a Android and BeckEnd developer for about 5 years.
I have finished my Bachelor degree in Computer Science and currently I am studying Masters with focus on machine learning and intelligent systems.
I really like programming with Kotlin so thats why I try to use it in almost everything.
